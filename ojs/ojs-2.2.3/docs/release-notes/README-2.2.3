OJS 2.2.3 Release Notes
CVS tag: ojs-2_2_3-0
Release date: Apr 9, 2009
=================================

Users of the COUNTER report plugin should be advised that the storage format
of COUNTER logs has changed since OJS 2.2.2. To migrate the existing logs
to the new structure, login in as Journal Manager, go to System Plugins,
find the COUNTER statistics plugin, and use the "migrate" link to read the
old (deprecated) log file into the new database structure. Sufficient time
should be allocated to this process, as it may take time. It may be necessary
to ensure that all journal URLs in the deprecated COUNTER log are correct,
or the migration process will not be able to determine which journal they
refer to and will ignore those log entries.
