It represents the last chance for the author to make any substantial changes to the text, as the next stage is restricted to typos and formatting corrections. \n\nThe file to be copyedited is in Word or .rtf format and therefore can be easily edited as a word processing document. This set of  instructions displayed here proposes two approaches to copyediting. The one is based on Microsoft Word\'s Track Changes feature and requires that the copyeditor, editor and author have access to this program. A second system, that is software independent, has been borrowed, with permission, from the Harvard Educational Review. The journal editor is in a position to modify these instructions, so suggestions can be made to improve the process for this journal. \n\n<h4>Copyediting Systems</h4>\n\n<b>1. Microsoft Word\'s Track Changes</b>\n\nUnder Tools in the menu bar, the feature Track Changes enables the copyeditor to make insertions (text appears in color) and deletions (text appears crossed out in color or in the margins as deleted). The copyeditor can post queries to both the author (Author Queries) and to the editor (Editor Queries) by inserting these queries in square brackets. The copyedited version is then uploaded and the editor is notified. The editor then reviews the text and notifies the author. \n\nThe editor and author should leave those changes with which they are satisfied. If further changes are necessary, the editor and author can make changes to the initial insertions or deletions, as well as make new insertions or deletions elsewhere in the text. Authors and editors should respond to each of the queries addressed to them, with responses placed inside the square brackets. \n\nAfter the text has been reviewed by editor and author, the copyeditor will make a final pass over the text accepting the changes in preparation for the layout and galley stage. \n\n\n<b>2. Harvard Educational Review </b>\n\n<b>Instructions for Making Electronic Revisions to the Manuscript</b>\n\nPlease follow the following protocol for making electronic revisions to your manuscript:\n\n<b>Responding to suggested changes</b>\n&nbsp; For each of the suggested changes that you accept, unbold the text\n&nbsp; For each of the suggested changes that you do not accept, re-enter the original text and <b>bold</b> it\n\n<b>Making additions and deletions</b>\n&nbsp; Indicate additions by <b>bolding</b> the new text\n&nbsp; Replace deleted sections with: <b>[deleted text]</b>\n&nbsp; If you delete a sentence or more, please indicate with a note, e.g., <b>[deleted 2 sentences]</b>\n\n<b>Responding to Queries to the Author (QAs)</b>\n&nbsp; Keep all QAs intact and bolded within the text. Do not delete them\n&nbsp; To reply to a QA, add a comment after it. Comments should be delimited using:\n<b>[Comment:</b>]\n&nbsp; e.g., <b>[Comment: Expanded discussion of methodology as you suggested]</b>\n\n<b>Making comments</b>\n&nbsp; Use comments to explain organizational changes or major revisions\n&nbsp; e.g., <b>[Comment: Moved the above paragraph from p. 5 to p. 7]</b>\n&nbsp; Note: When referring to page numbers, please use the page numbers from the printed copy of the manuscript that was sent to you. This is important since page numbers may change as a document is revised electronically.\n\n<h4>An Illustration of an Electronic Revision</h4>\n\n<b>The original \"manuscript\" file</b>\n\nBefore making dramatic departures from the structure and organization of your original manuscript, please check in with the co-chairs of your piece.
