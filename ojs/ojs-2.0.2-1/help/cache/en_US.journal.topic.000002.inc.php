The Journal Manager is also able to access the users registered under each of the roles, as well as add people to those roles. The Journal Manager is the one who can enroll people in different roles, although Editors and Section Editors can sign up Reviewers. On other hand, Authors and Readers can sign themselves up, as well as volunteer as Reviewers (if the appropriate entries are made in setup 2.6).</p>',
